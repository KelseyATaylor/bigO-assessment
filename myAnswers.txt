It appears that the Insert function (using unshift )utilizes O(n^2) time complexity and therefore takes an icreasingly longer time to execute as the array size increases--Time is increasing exponentially. The append function (using .push) only uses O(n) time complexity which, though time increase, it does so linearly. 

Extra Credit: Because unshift() has to increment all the elements that already present in the Array. But, push() has to insert an element at the end of the array, so none of the Array elements' index has to change.
